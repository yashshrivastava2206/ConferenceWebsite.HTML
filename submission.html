      <h1><font color="blue"><strong>GUIDLINES FOR AUTHOR</strong></font></h1>
      <p><font size="3px">Authors are requested to submit their manuscript in the format specified in the IEEE Paper Template. Prospective authors are invited to submit original technical papers for inclusion in the ICICT 2022.</font></p><br>
      <p><b>Important IEEE Policy Announcement:</b> The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.</p><br>
      <p>Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the IEEE will take action against any author who has engaged in either practice.</p><br>
      <p>Follow these links to learn more:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="">IEEE Web Page on Plagiarism</a></li>
        <li><a href="">IEEE Web Page on Double Submission</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p><br>
      <p>To be published in the IEEE ICICT 2022 Conference Proceedings and IEEE Xplore, the author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the FULL or LIMITED (member or non-member) rate. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion in the proceedings and IEEE Xplore.For authors with multiple accepted papers, one registration for each paper is required.</p><br>
      <p><strong>Paper Submission:</strong> Prospective authors are invited to submit papers of six (6) to eight (8) A4 pages (including tables, figures and references) in standard IEEE double-column format (it is absolutely necessary to respect the Styleguide for Papers). A blind peer-review process will be used to evaluate all submitted papers. Each full registration for the conference will cover a maximum of one paper; each student registration will cover a single paper only. Extra paper, 2nd paper and onwards, must be registered separately.</p><br>
      <p>The format instructions in the template must be followed, it is notably important to use the right paper format: A4 to have the right margins not to use page numbering (page footer must be empty)
      </p><br>
      <p>The IEEE Citation Reference may help you with the references in your paper. Get the list of IEEE recommended keywords from <a href="https://www.ieee.org/documents/taxonomy_v101.pdf">https://www.ieee.org/documents/taxonomy_v101.pdf</a> or send an empty e-mail to keywords@ieee.org with "IEEE Keywords" in the subject line.</p><br>
      <p>All submissions should be written in English with a maximum paper length of eight (8) printed pages strictly in IEEE double column format including figures, without incurring additional page charges. Two extra pages can be added with additional extra page charges.</p><br>

    </div>
    
    <h1><font color="blue"><strong>PLAGIARISM POLICY</strong></font></h1>
    <p>
      <ol><li>The paper prior to submission should be checked for plagiarism from licensed plagiarism softwares like Turnitin/iAuthenticate etc. The similarity content should not exceed 20% and not more than 4% from any single source (in any case either self contents or others).
        Further, you have to strictly implement the following ethical guidelines for publication:
        
        </li><li>Any form of self-plagiarism or plagiarism from others' work(s) should not be there in an article.
        
        If any model / concept / figure / table / data / conclusive comment by any previously published work is used in your article, you should properly cite a reference to the original work.

    <h1><font color="blue"><strong>REVIEW PROCESS</strong></font></h1>
    <p>
      All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through blind review process, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers. As an author, you are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing the reader to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Common sense and careful writing will go a long way towards preserving anonymity. Papers that do not conform to our blind submission policy will be rejected without review.
